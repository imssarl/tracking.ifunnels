Outdoor Birthday Games for Kids and the Kid at heart<br><br>


A birthday party without an enjoyable party game is like drinking coffee without sugar. Outdoor birthday games are not only fun but it can also be a form of exercise and lead some of your wired kids from their techno-gadgets to the outdoors. Though sometimes messing with the cake icing and splattering it unto anybody within reach is also an all-time favorite game (whether indoors or out in the sunshine), there are also fun games without the expense of destroying the cake. <br><br>

Traditionally, every party has a piñata (which comes from the Italian word pignatta meaning “fragile pot”). A piñata can be as simple as a clay pot decorated with ribbons and decorative tissue papers or as complex as a papier-mâché cartoon character. <br><br>

Traditionally in Mexican themed parties, it is shaped as a llama or a star. The piñata is filled with candies, toys, and other goodies, sometimes powder is included to add more fun to the game. <br><br>

The children forms a line and each of them will have the chance to break the piñata by hitting it with a stick three times. This game can be fun but it should be under strict adult supervision to avoid accidents. <br><br>

Another popular game is the limbo stick. It was very popular that even a song was dedicated to it, “The Limbo Rock” by Chubby Checker. To play the game two people hold a stick horizontally and the player must go under the stick without touching it. If the player is seen that the stick has touched a part of his body he is eliminated. At first, the game is easy as the stick is still held up high but as the stick is lowered this is where the challenge begins. The game goes and the last player left is proclaimed the winner. There are other variations of this game, a popular variation is wearing a pair of roller skates while doing the limbo. <br><br>

For those who love to dance the newspaper dance is perfect for them. It is played, of course, with a newspaper, and teams composed of two people. The newspapers must be of equal size for each team. To play the game the players dance around their newspaper and when the music stops they jump unto it. The newspaper is folded for the next music and the players feet must be inside the paper, if a part of the foot is outside the paper the team is eliminated. As the game progresses the size of the newspaper is reduced. Last team standing is proclaimed the winner. <br><br>

For parties by the pool water balloon fights, water polo or water football and water dodge ball are great games and all you need is a ball. A splash of water is always fun for children and the child at heart. <br><br>

Scavenger hunts give some sense of adventure to children. This is just like an Easter egg hunt wherein you hide the goodies and the children hunts for it. <br><br>

There are dozens of children’s outdoor games that it would be hard to keep track of them. The great thing is children just tend to bring the games played at school to parties and the only thing that adults must do is to let them have some clean fun and enjoy the party. <br><br>
