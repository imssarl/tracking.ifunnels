Planning A Set of Kids’ Party Game?<br><br> 


A successful children’s party needs a cool set of games to keep the kids busy and happy. It is usually the fun games and prizes that make a memorable imprint in children’s memories. Fun games keep parties alive and going. There are dozens and probably hundreds of party games that exist from around the world but before setting up any game, the party organizer should consider the following:

Ø	Location. The space area of where the party will be held should be considered in planning games. If there is a wide garden, probably the home backyard or garden, then elaborate games can be played and large garden toys are appropriate. If the area is much smaller, complicated games must not be played. <br><br>

Ø	Weather. Games and activities should be flexible to be played in both indoor and outdoor area. Be prepared to have a dozen reserved games in case of change in weather or mood of the party. <br><br>

Ø	Selected party games should be appropriate for the age group of children that will attend the event. Very young children, pre-school age, are better off playing short and simple games because they have a short attention span. Games appropriate for their age group are musical games and small puppet plays. Steer clear of mascots and games that include blindfolding, as these tend to frighten them. <br><br>

The older children are the more they can handle complicated games. Nevertheless, highly competitive activities should be avoided to prevent them from fighting. In party games, especially if prizes are involved, it is better if everybody is regarded as a winner and all participants can take home a bag of goodies. In this way, they can all have a great time. <br><br>

Ø	If organizers plan to install game equipments such as huge inflatable castles, slides, pools, or small children’s trains and other large toy equipments, safety should always be on the top list to prevent injury and harm to both children and adults. <br><br>

Ø	Organized games may keep children busy but there should also be a time for them to relax and play their own games freely. They usually just run around the area and sometimes play with their food. <br><br>

Ø	Adult supervision is also essential in every party game to oversee any problem and avoid accidents, though adults need not be too stiff or too strict or they will only muddle the playful ambience of the party. <br><br>

As for the games, if the area is spacious, particularly a wide-open yard or garden, renting, borrowing, or buying, large party toys can be a good plan. Children would love to jump and slide through inflatable castles or slides, and bounce inside a giant basket full of plastic balls. There are also miniature trains and merry-go-rounds that children can ride on, turning your backyard into a mini amusement park. Pool or snooker tables can also be set up, as well as air hockey tables, trampolines, pedal cars, and table footballs. Some parties even rent a small number of video arcade games. <br><br>

If party game equipment is not your thing, you can always rely on the good old traditional games such as the piñata game, relay games (dress relays, egg relay, etc), spin the bottle, musical chairs, the limbo stick, water balloon wars, dance freeze, tug of wars, scavenger hunts, and any game you and your child can think about. <br><br>

With all that tucked under your belt, let the games begin!<br><br>
