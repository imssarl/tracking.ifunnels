

This class enables you to establish a spider, and then call one page at a time.

Methods available:
	spiderStart($strStartPage) 
	spiderNextPage()
	getPage($pageToGet)
	getLinks($strURL="", $strPageContents, $strScrapeRegExp="")


Note that:
    getPage and getLinks can be used 'standalone' without a spider....


... But the main use of the class is along the lines of:
open a new object:
$objXXX = new spiderScraper;
[note; this doesn't start the spider; instead it allows you to access methods which do start the spider, as well as other methods such as link scraping or page fetching]

then start the spider
$objXXX -> spiderStart($strStartURL);

set the regexps for the spider [see example for use]:
$objSportSpider -> arrLinksRegex = $arrLinksRegex;

set the spider's [max] depth:
objSportSpider -> intCrawlDepth = 4;

then call pages one at a time:
for ($i = 1; $i <= 250; $i++) {
    $arrFetchedPage = $objSportSpider -> spiderNextPage();
}
