Title: Spider 1.0
Description: This code will spider a given URL and extrapolate links, e-mails, meta information (keywords, description, title), and a specified amount of words. This is useful for indexing personal webpages for use in conjuction with a search engine. Since it's in it's own class, it's very easy to use. This would work particularly well with a search enginge front end and database backend.
