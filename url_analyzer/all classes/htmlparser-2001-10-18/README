Unfortunately, there are some restrictions and inconveniences:
1. Comments are only in Chinese Big5. However the programme should be
   simple enough to be read without understanding the comments.
2. It is single-threaded. After all, PHP is not a programme language that
   uses threads and good for OOP.
3. Some extra attributes are added ('rows' and 'cols' for <table>) and thus
   violate the standard. <html><head><body> are considered as 'End Tag
   is necessary' tags, which violated the standard, too.
4. rowspans aren't correctly calculated.
5. DTD, HTML Comments, CSS, PHP, ASP tags and programmes are totally
   ignored. They're even absent in the generated tree. This may be the
   trouble for a CSS parser. This would be corrected in later releases.
