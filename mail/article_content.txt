Hello [USERNAME] ,

This is the reminder for the keyword project.

You are running the keyword project on [URL] started on date [PROJECT_CREATED_DATE]. Since this is the recurring project your project is now short of keywords. You have to add [NO_OF_ITEMS] keyword(s) before or on [PROJECT_PAUSED_DATE] otherwise your project status is set as paused.

Thanks & Regards
Controlpanel Administration
